# Steamdeck Hibernate After Sleep

This Repository is an Archive. I recommend using a systemd-sysext extensions for installing and persisting hibernation on your steamdeck: https://github.com/bentemple/steamos-extensions

This script is both outdated from the most recent version included in the above repository, and also will not persist the hibernation after sleep changes between steamdeck OS updates.

These are the basic scripts I created based on [nazar256's steam-deck-hibernation.md guide](https://github.com/nazar256/publications/blob/main/guides/steam-deck-hibernation.md)
